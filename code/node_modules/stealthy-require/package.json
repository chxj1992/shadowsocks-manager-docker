It clears the require cache.\n2. It calls a callback in which you require your module(s) without the cache kicking in.\n3. It clears the cache again and restores its old state.\n\nThe restrictions are:\n\n- [Native modules cannot be required twice.](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/5016) Thus this module bypasses the require cache only for non-native (e.g. JS) modules.\n- The require cache is only bypassed for all operations that happen synchronously when a module is required. If a module lazy loads another module at a later time that require call will not bypass the cache anymore.\n\nThis means you should have a close look at all internal require calls before you decide to use this library.\n\n## Installation\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/stealthy-require.png?downloads=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/stealthy-require)\n\nThis is a module for node.js and is installed via npm:\n\n``` bash\nnpm install stealthy-require --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nLet's say you want to bypass the require cache for this require call:\n\n``` js\nvar request = require('request');\n```\n\nWith `stealthy-require` you can do that like this:\n\n``` js\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n    return require('request');\n});\n```\n\nThe require cache is bypassed for the module you require (i.e. `request`) as well as all modules the module requires (i.e. `http` and many more).\n\nSometimes the require cache shall not be bypassed for specific modules. E.g. `request` is required but `tough-cookie` – on which `request` depends on – shall be required using the regular cache. For that you can pass two extra arguments to `stealthyRequire(...)`:\n\n- A callback that requires the modules that shall be required without bypassing the cache\n- The `module` variable\n\n``` js\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n    return require('request');\n},\nfunction () {\n    require('tough-cookie'); // No return needed\n    // You can require multiple modules here\n}, module);\n```\n\n## Usage with Module Bundlers\n\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) works out-of-the-box like described in the [Usage section](#usage) above.\n- [Browserify](http://browserify.org) does not expose `require.cache`. However, as of `browserify@13.0.1` the cache is passed as the 6th argument to CommonJS modules. Thus you can pass this argument instead:\n\n``` js\n// Tweak for Browserify - using arguments[5] instead of require.cache\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(arguments[5], function () {\n    return require('request');\n});\n```\n\n## Preventing a Memory Leak When Repeatedly Requiring Fresh Module Instances in Node.js\n\nIf you are using `stealthy-require` in node.js and repeatedly require fresh module instances the `module.children` array will hold all module instances which prevents unneeded instances to be garbage collected.\n\nAssume your code calls `doSomething()` repeatedly.\n\n``` js\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n\nfunction doSomething() {\n\n    var freshInstance = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n        return require('some-module');\n    });\n    \n    return freshInstance.calc();\n\n}\n```\n\nAfter `doSomething()` returns `freshInstance` is not used anymore but won’t be garbage collected because `module.children` still holds a reference. The solution is to truncate `module.children` accordingly:\n\n``` js\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n\nfunction doSomething() {\n\n    var initialChildren = module.children.slice(); // Creates a shallow copy of the array\n\n    var freshInstance = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n        return require('some-module');\n    });\n\n    module.children = initialChildren;\n\n    return freshInstance.calc();\n\n}\n```\n\nThe `slice` operation removes all new `module.children` entries created during the `stealthyRequire(...)` call and thus `freshInstance` gets garbage collected after `doSomething()` returns.\n\n\n## Technical Walkthrough\n\n``` js\n// 1. Load stealthy-require\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\n// This does nothing but loading the code.\n// It has no side-effects like patching the module loader or anything.\n\n// Any regular require works as always.\nvar request1 = require('request');\n\n// 2. Call stealthyRequire with passing the require cache and a callback.\nvar requestFresh = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n\n    // 2a. Before this callback gets called the require cache is cleared.\n\n    // 2b. Any require taking place here takes place on a clean require cache.\n    // Since the require call is part of the user's code it also works with module bundlers.\n    return require('request');\n    // Anything returned here will be returned by stealthyRequire(...).\n\n    // 2c. After this callback gets called the require cache is\n    // - cleared again and\n    // - restored to its old state before step 2.\n\n});\n\n// Any regular require again works as always.\n// In this case require returns the cached request module instance.\nvar request2 = require('request');\n\n// And voilà:\nrequest1 === request2 // -> true\nrequest1 === requestFresh // -> false\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo set up your development environment for `stealthy-require`:\n\n1. Clone this repo to your desktop,\n2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,\n3. hit `npm install`,\n4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and\n5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)\n\n`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nIf you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.\n\n## Change History\n\n- v1.1.1 (2017-05-08)\n    - Fix that stops `undefined` entries from appearing in `require.cache` *(Thanks to @jasperjn from reporting this in [issue #4](https://github.com/analog-nico/stealthy-require/issues/4))*\n- v1.1.0 (2017-04-25)\n    - Added ability to disable bypassing the cache for certain modules *(Thanks to @novemberborn for suggesting this in [issue #3](https://github.com/analog-nico/stealthy-require/issues/3))*\n    - Added section in README about a [potential memory leak](#preventing-a-memory-leak-when-repeatedly-requiring-fresh-module-instances-in-nodejs) *(Thanks to @Flarna and @novemberborn for bringing that up in [issue #2](https://github.com/analog-nico/stealthy-require/issues/2))*\n    - Performance optimizations *(Thanks to @jcready for [pull request #1](https://github.com/analog-nico/stealthy-require/pull/1))*\n- v1.0.0 (2016-07-18)\n    - **Breaking Change:** API completely changed. Please read the [Usage section](#usage) again.\n    - Redesigned library to support module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org)\n- v0.1.0 (2016-05-26)\n    - Initial version\n\n## License (ISC)\n\nIn case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.\n\nSee the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.\n",
